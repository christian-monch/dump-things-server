description: 'This schema is using the FLAT approach (Flexbile Low-complexity

  Annotation Technique) and is geared toward metadata entry and

  submission for pooling information across consortium sites and

  partners.


  It is to be taken as a demonstrator rather than a schema

  building block.


  More information may be available on the schema''s [about page](about).


  The schema definition is available as


  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.context.jsonld)

  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)

  - [LinkML YAML (static/resolved)](../unreleased.static.yaml)

  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)

      determined from some descriptor (e.g. a quantity, position, label/identifier).
      Technically, this declaration is done via an `AttributeSpecification` that combines
      a `predicate` with a value declaration and the attribute-related slots of a
      `Thing`. Importantly, such attributes are declared inline, because they do not
      have a unique identifier. If an identifier is available, a `Thing` declaration
      (see `relation`), and a qualification of that relationship via a `Statement`
      (see `characterized_by`) should be preferred.

    description: The most basic, identifiable item. In addition to the slots that
      are common between a `Thing` and an `AttributeSpecification` (see `ThingMixin`),
      two additional slots are provided. The `pid` slot takes the required identifier
      for a `Thing`. The `relation` slot allows for the inline specification of other
      `Thing` instances. Such a relation is unqualified (and symmetric), and should
      be further characterized via a `Statement` (see `characterized_by`). From a
      schema perspective, the `relation` slots allows for building self-contained,
      structured documents (e.g., a JSON object) with arbitrarily complex information
      on a `Thing`.

    comments:
    - There is no `name` property or similar, because the focus is on the identity
      of the distribution content, not how it might be named in a particular context.
      For example, an image in JPEG format might be names "20250825_102385.jpg" on
      a camera and "me_at_the_party.jpg" elsewhere, but it would be the exact same
      image. Expressing naming in some context should be done within the scope of
      the containing entity (see `named_parts`).

    - The key difference between a dataset and a document is the collection-nature
      of the dataset (multiple items of a kind in a collection), whereas a document
      is "one of its kind". A dataset could comprise multiple documents.
    - A document typically has at least one author. However, there are also generated
      documents (e.g., a birth certificate) for which this is irrelevant. And there
      are more roles that could be relevant for a document's provenance. Rather than
      adding them all, none is provided.

      information (vs a description or an identifier). There is `display_label`, if
      the need for a name is just for display purposes (e.g., to say something generic
      like 'thermometer').
    - Slot `name` is added to avoid `display_label` having to carry unique information.

    comments:
    - The class enables the expressing quantitative and qualitative assessments. For
      a quantitative value, the numerical value, and a possible unit is given. For
      a qualitative value, `same_as` is used to identify the quality of the assessment
      from a controlled vocabulary or standard term. Both approaches can be combined,
      for example when classifying numerical values into qualitative/ordinal categories.
